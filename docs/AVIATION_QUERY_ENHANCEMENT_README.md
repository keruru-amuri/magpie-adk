# Aviation Query Enhancement Implementation

## Overview

The `engineering_process_procedure_agent` has been enhanced with intelligent query processing specifically designed for aircraft MRO (Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul) and airline engineering contexts. This implementation improves RAG retrieval performance while preserving the original unaltered Databricks responses.

## Key Features

### 1. **Automatic Query Classification**
The system automatically classifies incoming queries into aviation-specific categories:

- **Maintenance**: Procedures, inspections, repairs, replacements
- **Troubleshooting**: Fault diagnosis, system failures, anomalies
- **Regulatory**: FAA/EASA compliance, airworthiness requirements
- **Safety**: Safety protocols, hazard management, SMS procedures
- **General**: Fallback for non-specific aviation queries

### 2. **Context-Rich Query Enhancement**
Each query type receives targeted enhancement with relevant aviation context:

#### Maintenance Queries
- Adds airworthiness requirements and compliance context
- References maintenance manuals (AMM/CMM) and MSG-3 standards
- Includes reliability-centered maintenance (RCM) principles

#### Troubleshooting Queries
- Adds diagnostic methodology and fault isolation procedures
- Includes safety considerations and test equipment requirements
- References aircraft system interdependencies

#### Regulatory Queries
- Adds FAA/EASA regulatory framework context
- References specific regulations (FAR Parts 43, 91, 145)
- Includes airworthiness directives and certification standards

#### Safety Queries
- Adds SMS (Safety Management System) principles
- Includes hazard identification and risk assessment context
- References emergency procedures and PPE requirements

### 3. **Aviation Terminology Integration**
The enhancement system automatically includes relevant aviation keywords:
- Airworthiness, FAA, EASA, MSG-3, RCM
- AMM, CMM, MPD, SB, AD, STC, PMA
- MOA, Part 145, AOG, MEL, CDL

## Implementation Details

### Core Classes

#### `AviationQueryClassifier`
- Keyword-based classification system
- Scores queries against aviation domain categories
- Returns the highest-scoring category or 'general' as fallback

#### `AviationQueryEnhancer`
- Template-based query enhancement
- Category-specific context injection
- Relevant keyword extraction and inclusion

### Enhanced Functions

#### `query_databricks_llm()`
- **New Parameter**: `enable_aviation_enhancement=True`
- Automatically applies enhancement before sending to Databricks
- Preserves original unaltered Databricks responses
- Includes enhancement metadata for transparency

#### `preview_query_enhancement()`
- **New Function**: Allows users to preview query enhancements
- Shows classification results and enhanced query text
- Provides transparency without making actual Databricks calls

## Usage Examples

### Basic Enhanced Query
```python
# Original query
"How do I replace brake pads on Boeing 737?"

# Enhanced query sent to Databricks
"Aircraft Maintenance Procedure Query: How do I replace brake pads on Boeing 737?

Please provide step-by-step maintenance procedures following aviation maintenance standards 
and regulatory requirements. Include references to applicable maintenance manuals (AMM/CMM), 
airworthiness requirements, safety precautions, required tools/equipment, and compliance with 
FAA/EASA regulations. Consider MSG-3 maintenance planning and reliability-centered maintenance principles."
```

### Troubleshooting Enhancement
```python
# Original query
"Engine failure during startup"

# Enhanced query sent to Databricks
"Aircraft MRO Troubleshooting Query: Engine failure during startup

Please provide comprehensive diagnostic and fault isolation procedures for aircraft systems. 
Include step-by-step troubleshooting methodology, safety considerations, required test equipment, 
regulatory compliance requirements, and references to applicable technical documentation. 
Consider aircraft system interdependencies and follow established maintenance practices."
```

## Benefits

### 1. **Improved RAG Performance**
- Context-rich queries improve document retrieval accuracy
- Aviation-specific terminology enhances search relevance
- Structured query format optimizes knowledge base matching

### 2. **Regulatory Compliance**
- Automatic inclusion of relevant regulatory frameworks
- Ensures responses consider compliance requirements
- References appropriate aviation standards and procedures

### 3. **Safety Enhancement**
- Systematic inclusion of safety considerations
- SMS principles integrated into all query types
- Risk assessment and hazard identification context

### 4. **Transparency and Control**
- Original Databricks responses preserved unchanged
- Enhancement metadata provided for full transparency
- Preview functionality allows users to see enhancements
- Enhancement can be disabled if needed

## Technical Architecture

### Preservation of Original Design
- **No Output Processing**: Databricks responses remain unaltered
- **Minimal Latency**: Enhancement adds negligible processing time
- **Backward Compatibility**: Original functionality preserved
- **Error Handling**: Robust fallback to original query if enhancement fails

### Integration Points
- Seamlessly integrated into existing `query_databricks_llm` function
- New `preview_query_enhancement` tool added to agent capabilities
- Enhanced agent descriptions and instructions for aviation focus
- Updated capability documentation

## Configuration

The enhancement system is enabled by default but can be controlled:

```python
# Enhanced query (default)
query_databricks_llm("maintenance procedure query")

# Disable enhancement if needed
query_databricks_llm("query", enable_aviation_enhancement=False)
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for expansion:
- Aircraft type-specific enhancements (commercial vs. general aviation)
- Integration with maintenance planning systems
- Real-time regulatory update integration
- Multi-language aviation terminology support
- Integration with aircraft configuration management

## Conclusion

This implementation successfully enhances query quality for aviation engineering contexts while maintaining the system's core principles of reliability, transparency, and information preservation. The enhancement provides significant value for aircraft MRO operations while preserving the flexibility to disable enhancement when needed.
