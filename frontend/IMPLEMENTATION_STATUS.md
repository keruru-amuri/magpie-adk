  - ‚úÖ Unified both status states into a single "Working..." indicator
  - ‚úÖ Maintained visual feedback (spinner, timestamp) while simplifying messaging
  - ‚úÖ Improved user experience by hiding technical complexity
  - ‚úÖ Added logic to prevent duplicate status indicators from showing simultaneously

### Technical Details
- **Files Modified**: `ChatInterface.tsx`
- **Status Logic**: Combined `isLoading` and `streamingMessage` states into unified "Working..." display
- **User Benefit**: Clear, consistent status indication without technical jargon
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved with improved messaging

## üéØ **LATEST UX IMPROVEMENTS** (Current Session)

  - ‚úÖ Implemented color-coded agent icons (Zap=Engineering, Database=Data Scientist, MessageCircle=General Chat)
  - ‚úÖ Added support for custom PNG avatar images in `/public/avatars/` directory
  - ‚úÖ Graceful fallback from custom images to Lucide React icons
  - ‚úÖ Updated message layout to show avatars for both user and assistant messages
  - ‚úÖ Enhanced streaming messages and loading states with agent avatars

### Technical Implementation Details
- **Dual Agent System**: Separated `activeAgent` (always Master Coordinator) from `displayAgent` (UI selection)
- **Agent Store Filtering**: `getUserFacingAgents()` function filters out master_coordinator from UI
- **Routing Architecture**: All messages route through Master Coordinator ‚Üí Specialist Agent ‚Üí User sees specialist response
- **Avatar Component**: Supports custom images with automatic fallback to icons
- **Message Layout**: Redesigned chat bubbles with avatar integration and improved spacing
- **Color Coding**: Each agent has distinct colors (orange=Engineering, blue=Data Scientist, green=General Chat)
- **Responsive Design**: Avatars scale appropriately (sm/md/lg sizes) and work on all devices
- **Future-Ready**: Avatar directory structure ready for custom PNG assets

### User Experience Benefits
- **Eliminated Confusion**: Single file attachment workflow through chat interface only
- **Enhanced Navigation**: Collapsible sidebar provides space efficiency and user control
- **Functional Session Management**: Users can now create new chat sessions with active agent
- **Clear Agent Identification**: Visual indicators show which specialist agent is responding
