This means that for ""normal"" AMOS Customers operating or managing Aircraft / Helicopters, this DB column is not being filled anymore, effective with AMOS Stable V11.00.

If you use a Netline System to import flight data: look in DB Table ""ac_util_netl_detail"", column ""netline_leg_id"" in case you want to retrieve the corresponding Netline-internal ID of a flight by matching the AMOS flight`s unique DB key ""ac_utilization.legno_i"" with ""ac_util_netl_detail.legno_i"".

If you use some other FlightOPS system (e.g. AIMS, PDC.dk): look in DB Table ""leg_additional"", column ""ext_system_leg_id"" in case you want to retrieve the corresponding OPS System-internal ID of a flight (if that ID is provided at all, might be NULL if not supported by OPS System) by matching the AMOS flight`s unique DB key ""ac_utilization.legno_i"" with ""leg_additional.legno_i"".",12
